<p class='info'><strong>Please note that the files listed below are now stored temporarily in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/quqwcm244sqoh5a/CiKpeYHOTi">the AGRIP folder on Dropbox</a> whilst we move our hosting and development services.  The links below will be broken for now, but you can still get the files from the Dropbox folder.</strong></p>

<p>This section explains how you can download AudioQuake. Before we link to the files, however, please be aware of the following important notices.</p>
<ul>
<li>AudioQuake, as with Quake is suitable for people aged 15 and over.</li>
<li>The game works on Linux (PowerPC and x86) and Windows (2000, XP and, we're told, Vista). It doesn't work on Windows 9x and NT is untested. It is hoped that it could be ported to MacOS X in future (it wouldn't take too much work&mdash;we just need an OS X user to volunteer to help).</li>
<li>Please read the section on <a href='#sup'>Community, Support and Bugs</a> for information on how to get the most out of the game, its community and to help improve it for others.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name='dl-files' id="dl-files">Files</a></h2>
<p>A number of different setup files are available depending on your system. For Linux users, the choices are fairly self-explanatory. For Windows users, please bear the following in mind.</p>
<h3><a name='dl-files-doze' id="dl-files-doze">Notes for Windows Users</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>The installer you want depends on your Windows version.
<ul>
<li>If you're using Windows 2000, you want the full installer with SAPI. We recommend you use the "Mary" voice.</li>
<li>If you're using Windows XP, please get the version with the extra voices for XP so you can use the "Mary" voice, which is infinitely better than the default of "Sam".</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please go to the Speech Control Panel applet to set up your chosen SAPI voice after installation (we recommend "Mary").</li>
<li>ActiveState Perl is required by the game launcher so if you don't have it, please instruct the setup program to download and install it for you. You need only do this once&mdash;even if you uninstall AudioQuake, ActiveState Perl will remain, so you won't need to download it again if you install AudioQuake again in future.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name='dl-files-list' id="dl-files-list">File List</a></h3>
<p><strong>Please note that we've had to move the location of all of the files (on 20/03/2010) so the installers will now no longer look in the right place for the data files.  They can now be found at <a href='releases/data/'>the releases data directory</a> and we suggest that you download them manually.</strong></p>
<p>Releases for each platform (Mac, Linux and Windows) and then source code releases are given in groups below.  At the end you can find links to archived releases, which may be of interest.</p>
<p>If you want to create levels you'll need to get the Level Description Language (LDL) too, from <a href='/ldl/'>the LDL page</a>.</p>
