value00=This is a survey about the initial release of the Level Description Language (latest version: 0.0.2, released on the 27th of April 2008).  We would be grateful if you could fill it in by the 2nd of June 2008, once you have tried LDL - though if you're reading this after that date, please do still fill it in; your feedback will not be ignored.
value01=The survey is about your feelings towards LDL and is designed to give us information on the areas of research needed to improve the system, or systems like it, in the medium to long term.
value02=As it primarily for research, not development, purposes (though development will be influenced by the outcome), please do not use this form to report bugs.  If you find bugs that stop you using the system, please report them to the mailing list and/or Launchpad.  We will then do our best to fix them before you fill in the survey.
value03=You are under no obligation to fill in this form and my withdraw at any time. No personal data will be collected without your permission.  We will never sell or even broadcast any data that can identify you to anyone else.  The data will be held at Loughborough University, UK and used in the preparation of academic papers and to inform the future direction of LDL.  The data will be deleted at the conclusion of this research project.
value04=Thank you very much for your time and feedback.

[04.12]
type=info
value00=The next few questions are about any experience or knowledge you have of tools similar to LDL.  When answering them, please bear in mind that other accessible game editors may offer programming features.  LDL does not because it is just a map description system.  The programming side of AudioQuake (via the ZQuake engine and QuakeC) is already accessible and in use, so is not the subject of these questions.
value01=(If you do have problems or suggestions regarding the programming side of AudioQuake, please discuss them on the AGRIP-discuss mailing list.)
