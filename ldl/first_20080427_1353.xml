<!-- This is a work-in-progress map by Matthew McLarren.  It was posted to the AGRIP-discuss mailing list soon after the first LDL test release was made and is included here for historical reasons, because it was the first time a blind person has made a map for a mainstream 3D game.  It was successfully compiled and run at 1353 on Sunday the 27th of April 2008 by Matthew Tylee Atkinson. -->
