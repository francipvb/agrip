AudioQuake and Distributed Software - Legal Information
========================================================

ONLY PORTIONS OF THIS BUNDLE ARE "FREE SOFTWARE".  YOU MUST ACCEPT ALL OF THE LICENCES DESCRIBED HERE BEFORE CONTINUING WITH INSTALLATION.

This file aims to clarify the licencing terms that AudioQuake and the supporting programs distributed with it fall under.  It exists to make sure that you're completely aware of what you (and we) can and can't do with the software.  Each section describes a component of the AudioQuake distribution and the licence used for it.


Quake Data Files
=================

There are two types of Quake data file -- the shareware data (mostly contained in "pak0.pak") and the registered data (mostly contained in "pak1.pak").  Both types of data cannot be modified.  They are owned by id Software.  The shareware data can be redistributed as-is but the registered data cannot.

The Quake data files constitute the Quake sounds, models, textures, maps, miscellaneous 2D graphics, original Quake text files (such as the README, MANUAL and TECHINFO files), DOS/Windows game executables, VXD, BAT and DLL files and the original Quake game code (not used by AudioQuake but distributed as part of the Quake data files).


mindgrid:audio Quake Sound Files
=================================

Please visit http://www.mindabuse.com/mindgrid/audio/quake/ for more information (and to give feedback) after reading this file.

These sounds upgrade the ones in Quake to give you a truly visceral experience :-).  Note that the documentation supplied with the distribution points out that the sounds are licenced material and are not to be redistributed outside of their original form (the setup program downloads a compressed version of the "mindgrid-audio_quake_2003.02.22/" directory and extracts it for you).  They are not to be used for modifying anything but Quake, either.  The aforementioned directory contains both README files, which echo the information given on the web site above.


ZQuake
=======

This is the QuakeWorld game engine that AudioQuake is based on.  It is distributed under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).  For more information, please read the COPYING file.

An online version of the GPL can be found at http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html


AudioQuake (The Program)
=========================

Our modified gamecode (the .dat files in "agrip/"), maps (files in "agrip/maps") and sounds (files in and under the "agrip/sounds" directory) fall under this category.  It is the code and data that we have added to the ZQuake QuakeWorld engine, game code and original Quake data to make it accessible.  The licence used here is the GNU GPL.  For details on what this means, please consult the COPYING file.


AudioQuake (The Documentation)
===============================

The manual for AudioQuake is distributed under the GNU Free Documentation Licence (FDL).  A copy of this is included in an appendix of the manual.
