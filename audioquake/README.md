What is AudioQuake?
====================

AudioQuake is essentially a series of (minimal) modifications to the game Quake by id Software that enable blind and vision-impaired people to play it -- online or off, co-operatively and competititively.

It is also possible to make modifications ("mods") for the game that change the way it behaves -- from adding weapons to changing the whole personality of the game.  (For level, or "map" editing, please refer to the companion Level Description Language (LDL) project.)

Learning and Using AudioQuake

We're in the process of updating the documentation to reflect the revamped setup and launcher, though nothing major has changed in the gameplay area.  If you have DocBook installed, you can build the documentation from a checkout of the source tree.
