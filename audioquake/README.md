What is AudioQuake?
====================

AudioQuake is essentially a series of modifications to the game Quake by id Software that enable blind and vision-impaired people to play it.  It is based on our earlier game, AccessibleQuake, and already provides you with the ability to play Quake.  However, when AudioQuake reaches version 1.0.0, it will provide the following outstanding new features:

* Full Internet multiplayer support - play with and against your friends on-line!
* "Implicit Accessibility" - Enhanced fun and better accessibility provided by 3D sound and special effects (currently the game uses stereo).
* Accessible level editing!

This version fully supports Internet play.  The other two features mentioned above will be implemented as we reach 1.0.0.

There is a lot more to AudioQuake than this - the fact that it is Free for everyone to use and modify along with the fact that it is a conversion of a game that only sighted people were able to play.  The full user manual (details follow) explains these points in more detail.
