ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Code
=====

The ZQuake QuakeWorld engine and QuakeC repository are used as the basis for AudioQuake.  They are contributed to by a number of developers.  You can find out more at: http://zquake.frag.ru/

Though the Quake/QuakeWorld communities have always been very helpful, some developers should get special mention.  They are Tonik, Spike, Fuh and Tei.  This is for answering my questions and allowing me commit access to ZQuake.

All additional engine and QuakeC code, except for the bot, was written by Matthew Tylee Atkinson.  However, some of it was based on ideas found around the 'net.  This file details the people who have influenced this project by sharing these ideas and techniques.

The contributions of the various people and parties here have helped make this project possible -- thanks guys!

* id software -- for the game, tools and GPL'ing them!
* QuakeForge -- for making the engine even cooler (and packaging it).
* Ze0, Bot Epidemic webmaster -- Footsteps (modified by me).
* David "DarkGrue" Hesprich (darkgrue@iname.com) -- QuakeC Reference Manual.
* Ferrara Francesco (frank@aerre.it) and Olivier Montanuy for the ``QuakeC Manual 1.0'' (1996) and the example (not sure who its by, unfortunately; may have come from the Quake-C Patch Archives) 13.6 - the Radar.
* Daniel Rinehart <danielr@neophi.com>, Lauri Alanko <mivars@cc.helsinki.fi>, Juergen P. Meier <JPM@mailserv.rz.fh-muenchen.de>, Pat Pinatiello <pat@telmaron.com> for the ``Quake Console Command Pages, Quake v1.06''.
* venomus <MrMan@mrman58.freeserve.co.uk> for his ``3D Holographic Radar'' tutorial -- this showed how to find the origin of a brush entity.  [ No longer used. ]
* LordHavoc (of DarkPlaces fame) for the tracebox() QuakeC built-in.
* Darryl "Coffee" Atchison <coffee@planetquake.com> for the Tutor Bot.  This is used pretty much in its entirety.  (It's PD so therefore GPL compatible.)
* The residents of the QuakeSrc forums -- including Spike, for the advice and information they've given to me.
* The Win32 port of ``unzip'' by the GNU Utilities for Win32 project at unxutils.sourceforge.net.


Sounds
=======

The sounds in AudioQuake were all designed and worked on by Sabahattin Gucukoglu.  However, some of the sounds were based on sounds in other projects.  The AGRIP project deeply thanks the following open projects and/or people for making their sounds available to us under compatible licenses that permit liberal reuse, modification and redistribution in our own project -- the job would have been a heck of a lot harder without their gracious contributions to open artwork:

* Johannes Prix and Chris Hoeppner produced sound effects for Freedroid -- http://freedroid.sourceforge.net/
* Mathias Broxvall is the author of Trackballs -- http://trackballs.sourceforge.net/
* The former crack.com released all material work done on Golgotha, inclusive of sounds, into the Public Domain, a move that still never ceases to surprise some people -- they could have done so many other things with their work that would have benefited them in some way.  We are, of course, among the many open source and art advocates who are very grateful for this chivalrous decision on their part.  Read more about crack.com and Golgotha on the pages at http://jonathanclark.com/.
* Davy loots (davy.loots@lenaers.com) provided some footstep sounds, which were much needed and are very much appreciated!
* Nexuiz Project ( http://www.nexuiz.com/ ) for some nicely refinable sound used in the ESR line-of-sight, for the sounds used in our ICC 2005 sound mod demonstration, and generally for their commitment to opening everything necessary, artwork included, for an entirely playable open source deathmatch first-person shooter.

Documentation
==============

A very important, often overlooked area!  The DocBook manual and README files were written by Matthew Tylee Atkinson.  Here is the list of external resources and people that have helped:

* David Rugge <davidrugge@mindspring.com>, Mark Galassi <rosalia@galassi.org> and Eric Bischoff <e.bischoff@noos.fr> for ``Writing Documentation Using DocBook - A Crash Course''.
* Norman Walsh and the DocBook Team.
* Jim Crafton of the Code Project for his article on DocBook and XSL.
* Dan York for the tldp.org XSL files.
