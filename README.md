AGRIP AudioQuake and Level Description Language (LDL)
======================================================

The Accessible Gaming Rendering Independence Possible (AGRIP) project aims to make mainstream games and development tools accessible to blind and vision-impaired gamers.

**We are in the process of ensuring the code runs on modern platforms and currently it is only supported on the Mac, but Windows support will return ASAP.**

AudioQuake
-----------

AudioQuake is a version of Quake (by id Software) that has enhanced audio and speech output, so that blind and vision-impaired gamers can play it (including a number of the standard maps).  The code is based on the ZQuake engine, is mature and supports various forms of networked play.  A tutorial, documentation and some specifically-designed accessible maps are included.

It is also possible to create mods for the game, by changing the sounds (and other content) and modifying the QuakeC gamecode.  A number of community members have created mods, from "excessive overkill"-style bloodbaths, to the obligatory Star Wars conversions.  The standard modding tools can be used for this, as they are inherrently accessible.  For creating maps, read on.

**Note:** You need access to some official Quake data files for the game to work.  The shareware version and an enhanced sound pack are automatically installed if not present.  You can also use the full ("registered") Quake data files too.

Level Description Language
---------------------------

The Level Description Language (LDL) allows people to describe maps for the game using structured text and have the computer automatically create the 3D world.  It is currently at the proof-of-concept stage, but has been used by blind people to make maps for the game.
