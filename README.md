AGRIP AudioQuake and Level Description Language (LDL)
======================================================

AudioQuake
-----------

AudioQuake is a version of Quake (by id Software) that has enhanced audio and speech output, so that blind and vision-impaired gamers can play it.  The code is based on the ZQuake engine, is mature and supports various forms of networked play.  A tutorial, documentation and some accessible maps are included.

Level Description Language
---------------------------

The Level Description Language (LDL) allows people to describe maps for the game using structured text and have the computer automatically create the 3D world.  It is currently at the proof-of-concept stage, but has been used by blind people to make maps for the game.

Porting In-progress
--------------------

We are in the process of ensuring the code runs on modern platforms and currently it is only supported on the Mac, but Windows support will return ASAP.
